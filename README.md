##Citizens Grievance Reporting Portal##



Theme: Environmental Awareness

Developing a web application to report all grievances faced by citizens regarding environmental issues in their locality. The complaints will be forwarded to the concerned authorities. The citizens can track the status of their complaints. This web application will have two types of users:

1.	Citizens (report the problem)
2.	Concerned officials (resolve the problem)

Key Features:

•	Complaints can be prioritized and sorted with the help of a polling/upvoting system wherein citizens facing a previously reported issue can upvote it.
•	The concerned official/expert can view all complaints with respect to their area and update status of complaint.
•	Categorizing the complaints on the basis of the field they are related to: Air pollution, Water pollution, Garbage disposal etc.
•	The grievances can be filed under appropriate category (District Administration/ Mantralaya departments). Once grievance has been submitted, a tracking number will be generated. Citizens can track the status of the grievance with the help of the tracking number.
•	Citizens can provide feedback for the quality of resolution of grievance through a "upvote" option or in a comment section.
